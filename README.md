# Tetris Ai

#### A short intro
Hi there! I am really happy that you find this short book. Basically this is my own discovery journey on how to build an Artificial Intelligence to play the game of ___Tetris___. This is my first attempt to try ai-related project and I actually find it really interesting and so I want to note down this great experience. If you are also interested in my story of building an ai to play Tetris, go ahead and have fun!
